# Exploring eBay Car Sales Data

In this project we will work on a dataset of used cars from **eBay Kleinanzeigen**, a classifieds section of the German eBay website. The dataset was originally `scraped` and uploaded to Kaggle by user **[orgesleka](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka)**. 

The `goal` of this project is `to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.`
